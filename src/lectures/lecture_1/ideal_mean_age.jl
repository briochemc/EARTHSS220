#---------------------------------------------------------
# ## The model
#---------------------------------------------------------

# We will simulate the ideal mean age of water.
# That is, the average amount of time since a water parcel had last contact with the surface.

# ### Tracer equation
#
# The ideal mean age is transported with water, is equal to $0$ at the surface, and increases by one second every second everywhere.
# In other words, the 3D field of the age, $a$, is governed by the tracer equation
#
# $$\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \left[ \boldsymbol{u} - \mathbf{K} \cdot \nabla \right] a + 1,$$
#
# where $\nabla \cdot \left[ \boldsymbol{u} - \mathbf{K} \cdot \nabla \right]$ is a differential operator that represents the transport by the ocean circulation.
# ($\boldsymbol{u}$ is the 3D vector field for the advection and $\mathbf{K}$ is the diffusivity matrix.)
# In the equation above, we also assume that there is the boundary condition that $a=0$ at the surface.

#---------------------------------
# ### Discretized tracer equation
#---------------------------------

# In AIBECS, the linear differential operator defined by $\nabla \cdot \left[ \boldsymbol{u} - \mathbf{K} \cdot \nabla \right]$ is approximated by a constant matrix $\mathbf{T}$ when discretizing the continuous 3D ocean onto the model grid.
# This matrix can be small (e.g., for models with a few boxes), or large, like for the OCIM (more on the OCIM later).
# Similarly, the continuous 3D field of the age, $a$, is discretized into a column-vector, $\boldsymbol{a}$.
# (We represent scalars in italic, vectors in bold italic, and matrices in upstraight bold.)

# In the discrete case, we replace the boundary condition (that $a = 0$ at the surface) by imposing $\boldsymbol{a} = 0$ in the surface layer of the model grid.
# In practice, this is done by restoring $\boldsymbol{a}$ to $0$ with a very short timescale.
# The tracer equation thgus takes the form of
#
# $$\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{a}}{\partial t} = -\mathbf{T} \, \boldsymbol{a} + 1 - \boldsymbol{a} / \tau,$$
#
# where $\tau$ will be chosen to be very small, ensuring that $\boldsymbol{a}$ is very close to $0$ at the surface.
# The first term represents the transport by the ocean circulation, the second term the source of 1 second per second everywhere, and the last term the fast relaxation.

#---------------------------------
# ### Steady-state
#---------------------------------

# The steady-state is the equilibrium that would be reached if we wait long enough for $a$ to not change anymore.
# Mathematically, the steady-state is also the state for which
#
# $$\frac{\partial a}{\partial t} = 0.$$

# Computationally, in the discrete case, this means that we just need to solve
#
# $$0 = -\mathbf{T} \, \boldsymbol{a} + 1 - \boldsymbol{a} / \tau$$
#
# to find $\boldsymbol{a}$.
# More specifically, we need to solve
#
# $$(\mathbf{T} + \mathbf{I} / \tau) \, \boldsymbol{a} = 1.$$

# Now that we have the equations laid down, let us chose the circulation transport matrix, $\mathbf{T}$.

# ## Using AIBECS

#

# AIBECS can interpret tracer equations as long as you arrange them under the generic form:
#
# $$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}{\partial t} = \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{p}),$$
#
# where $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{p})$ is the rate of change of the state and $\boldsymbol{p}$ is the vector of model parameters.
# We only track the age here, so that the entire state of the system is determined by the age itself.
# In other words, here, $\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{a}$.

# We will use AIBECS to find the steady-state of the system.
# For AIBECS, this translates into finding the solution of $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{p}) = 0$.

# We start by telling Julia that we want to use the AIBECS package via

#---------------------------------
# ### The circulation
#---------------------------------

# We will use the circulation output from the Ocean Circulation Inverse Model (OCIM) version 1.1.
# Basically, the OCIM provides researchers and oceanographers with a big sparse matrix that represents the global ocean circulation (advection and diffusion), which allows them to efficiently simulate the transport of passive tracers, like the age.
# (For more details, see Tim DeVries's [website](https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/models-and-data-products/) and references therein.)
# With AIBECS, the OCIM circulation can be loaded really easily, by simply typing

const wet3d, grd, T_OCIM = AIBECS.OCIM1.load()
typeof(T_OCIM), size(T_OCIM)

# Here, I have used the `const` prefix to tell Julia these are constants (it helps Julia's compiler)
#
#md # !!! note
#md #     Julia may ask you to download the OCIM matrix for you, in which case you should say yes (i.e., type `y`).
#md #     Once downloaded, AIBECS will remember where it downloaded the file and it will only load it from your laptop.
#nb # > **Note**
#nb # > Julia may ask you to download the OCIM matrix for you, in which case you should say yes (i.e., type `y`).
#nb # > Once downloaded, AIBECS will remember where it downloaded the file and it will only load it from your laptop.
#
# Additionally to downloading the OCIM file, the `load()` command loads 3 variables in the Julia workspace:
# - `wet3d` — a 3D array of the model grid, filled with `1`'s at "wet" grid boxes and `0`'s and "land" grid boxes.
# - `grd` — a dictionary containing information about the 3D grid of the OCIM circulation, like the latitude, longitude, and depth of each grid boxes. `grd` is a dictionary (i.e., a `Dict` in Julia, which is equivalent to a `struct` in MATLAB or a `dict` in python).
# - `T_OCIM` — the transport matrix representing advection and diffusion.
#
# The second line in command above tells you the type and the size of `T_OCIM`.
# It is a sparse matrix (CSC just means that it is stored in Compressed Sparse Column format) and is quite big!
#md # !!! note
#md #     A sparse matrix is just a matrix with very few non-zero entries.
#md #     Computationally, sparse matrices are stored differently than full matrices to save memory (no need to save all those zeros), and are much faster to use too!

# Anyway, this looks good, so let's move on with setting up the model!
#
# We have already loaded the transport matrix, `T_OCIM`, for the ocean circulation, but we must tell AIBECS that it applies to the age.
# To do that, we define a function of the parameters (although there are no parameters involved in this case, this is just the way AIBECS works for the moment).

T_age(p) = T_OCIM

# (Functions in Julia can be created in one line, just as above.)
# That's it for the circulation.
# Now, let's define the local sources and sinks.

#---------------------------------
# ### The local sources and sinks
#---------------------------------

# We will denote the age, $\boldsymbol{a}$, by the variable `age` in Julia.
# (It's good practice to use explicit names!)
# We need to translate the local sources and sinks in our discretized state function $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{p})$ into Julia code.

# #### The source
#--------------------------

# Remember the age increases by $1$ second every second and everywhere.
# So its source function is equal to, well, `1`! (seconds per seconds means it is unitless).
# Let's create the local source function:

source_age(age, p) = 1

# #### The sink
#--------------------------

# Recall that the age must also be $0$ at the surface.
# And that we implement this boundary condition by restoring the age very fast to $0$ in the surface layer.
# This will act as the sink for the age.
# But first, we need to figure out where "the surface layer" is.
# To do that, AIBECS can generate a number of useful constants for you.
# (You can see the list of functions by typing `varinfo(AIBECS)` at the REPL.)
# Here we will use the vector of grid box depths, `z`, which AIBECS can generate for us via

const z = vector_of_depths(wet3d, grd)

# So what is the top layer?
# Let's investigate what's the minimum depth:

minimum(z)

# The surface layer in the OCIM grid has its center at about $18\,$m depth.
# We can create a mask of the surface layer via `z .< 20`.
# (This will return a vector of `0`s and `1`s, depending on whether the depth, `z`, is less than `20`.)
#
#md # !!! note
#md #     In Julia (like in MATLAB), placing a dot, `.`, in front of operators is a convenient way to do element-wise operations.
#nb # > **Note**
#nb # > In Julia (like in MATLAB), placing a dot, `.`, in front of operators is a convenient way to do element-wise operations.
#
# Then, we implement the local sink by restoring the age to `0` with a timescale `τ`, via

function sink_age(age, p)
    τ = p.τ
    return age .* (z .< 20) / τ
end

#md # !!! note
#md #     Julia allows you to use unicode for your functions and variables, like for `τ`.
#nb # > **Note**
#nb # > Julia allows you to use unicode for your functions and variables, like for `τ`.
#
# Here, we have defined a Julia function using the `function` keyword because the sink is a bit more complicated, so that we needed two lines to define it.
# The first line unpacks the model parameters, which is just the restoring timescale, `τ`, in this case.
# We will chose the value for `τ` later.

# #### Net sources and sinks
#--------------------------

# The sources minus the sinks are simply defined by

sms_age(age, p) = source_age(age, p) .- sink_age(age, p)

# #### Model parameters
#--------------------------

# We must define the parameters... And AIBECS comes with an API for that!

t = empty_parameter_table()    # initialize table of parameters
add_parameter!(t, :τ, 1u"s")   # add the parameter we want (τ = 1s)
initialize_Parameters_type(t)  # Generate the parameter type
t

# Note, in particular, that we gave our parameter `τ` a unit.
# Yes, Julia comes with some nice functionality to deal with units directly!
# The lines above created a table that contains all the info for generating the parameters vector, $\boldsymbol{p}$.
# For AIBECS, we will denote it by `p₀`:

p₀ = Parameters()

# Here we did not really need to create `p₀` as a parameters vector, since it has only one element, `τ`, in it.
# However, we are here to learn, and this structure and functionality comes in very handy when one deals with many parameters.
# (And as you can imagine, having all the parameters in a nice table ready for being used in a publication comes quite handy!)



# #### State function and Jacobian
#--------------------------

# Similarly to `p₀`, let's create a state `x₀` to start with.
# The vector `x₀` will be our initial guess for the state.
# Let's assume that the age is `1` (seconds) everywhere (as an initial guess):

const nb = number_of_wet_boxes(wet3d)  # number of wet boxes
x₀ = ones(nb)

# The first line above defines the number of wet grid boxes, `nb`.
# Here, this is also the length of the state vector `x`, because there is only one tracer, `age`.
# In the second line, the `ones` function creates a vector of `1`s of the size you give it (the number of wet grid boxes, `nb`, here, which we defined as a constant earlier).

# Finally, the last step for the set up is to define $\boldsymbol{F}$.
# Using AIBECS, this is done via

T_matrices = (T_age,)           # bundles all the transport matrices in a tuple
sources_minus_sinks = (sms_age,) # bundles all the source-sink functions in a tuple
F, ∇ₓF = state_function_and_Jacobian(T_matrices, sources_minus_sinks, nb) # generates the state function (and its Jacobian!)
F(x₀,p₀)

# That's it!
# We have just created a model of the mean age.
#
#
# Lines 2 and 3 are just telling AIBECS
# - what transport matrices it should use for the transport of these tracers, and
# - and what local sources and sinks should be appplied to these tracers
#
#md # !!! note
#md #     The `(x,)` syntax returns a tuple of one element — the comma is necessary because without it, `(x)` would be just like `x` with brackets around it.
#md #     This interface of AIBECS was developed for case with multiple tracers in mind, and might look a bit odd for a single tracer.
#md #     But in the future, this might be cleaned up to be easier to work with single tracers.

#nb # > But in the future, this might be cleaned up to be easier to work with single tracers.

# The fourth line creates two functions:
# - `F` — the numerical version of the **state function**, $\boldsymbol{F}$, of our model of the mean age, and
# - `∇ₓF` — the **Jacobian matrix** of the state function, i.e., $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\boldsymbol{F}$.
# Yes, AIBECS just automatically created an exact derivative of your input, using autodifferentiation via dual numbers.
# (I'd be very excited to detail how this is implemented here, but it is an entirely different discussion.)

# The last line just checks that our generated `F` works with our initial guess `x₀` and parameter vector `p₀`.

# #### Solving for the steady-state
#--------------------------

# The Jacobian, `∇ₓF` is essential to solving the steady-state equation $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{p}) = 0$ fast.
# Specifically, solving $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{p}) = 0$ is done via Newton's method.
# By starting from an initial guess, that you will have to provide, it will iterate over this recursion relation
#
# $$\boldsymbol{x}_{k+1} = \boldsymbol{x}_{k} - \nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}_{k}, \boldsymbol{p})^{-1} \boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}_{k}, \boldsymbol{p})$$
#
# until $\boldsymbol{F}(\boldsymbol{x}_{k}, \boldsymbol{p})$ is sufficiently small.
# Now I should note that here, our age model is linear in $x$ (or `age` in our code), so that the solution will be found in a single iteration, or a sinle "matrix inversion", as could be seen from our steady-state equation for $\boldsymbol{a}$.

#md # !!! note
#md #     AIBECS comes with a built-in algorithm and an API to solve for the steady-state, so you don't have to worry about all these details!

# ##### Define the Steady-state problem in AIBECS

# First, we create an instance of the steady-state problem, via

prob = SteadyStateProblem(F, ∇ₓF, x₀, p₀)

# where we have simply provided the state function, $\boldsymbol{F}$, the Jacobian, $\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\boldsymbol{F}$, the initial guess and the parameters.
# The `SteadyStateProblem` function is a standard "DiffEqBase" constructor that I have overloaded in my package so that you can easily generate the model here.



# ##### Solve for the steady-state with AIBECS

# Finally, we can find the solution in litterally one line, via the `solve` function:

age = solve(prob, CTKAlg())

# Here, I have provided the `solve` function with two things:
# - the problem, `prob`, which we just defined, and
# - the quasi-Newton algorithm that I wrote in Julia, denoted by `CTKAlg()` after C.T. Kelley, who originally wrote it in MATLAB.
#
# The last line should take about 10 seconds to 1 minute, depending on your laptop.
# That's it!
# We solved for the steady state!
# Everyone here deserves a nice tap on the shoulder — Good job!
# Now let's see what this age looks like on a map




#---------------------------------------------------------
# ## Figures
#---------------------------------------------------------

# We will plot a horizontal slice of the age at about 1000m depth using Cartopy.

# First, we must rearrange `age` into the 3D model grid.
# For that we will need the vector of the indices of wet points in the 3D grid, which we will denote by `iwet`, and which AIBECS generates via

const iwet = indices_of_wet_boxes(wet3d)

# We then rearrange the column vector `age` into a 3D array via

age_3D = NaN * wet3d # creates a 3D array of NaNs of the same size as `wet3d`
age_3D[iwet] = age   # Fills the wet grid boxes with the age values
size(age_3D)         # Just to check the size of age_3D

# The last line just shows you the size of `age_3D`, which is a 3D-array as expected.

# Now let us find the index of the depth that is closest to $1000\,$m.
# To do that we must use the depth information contained in `grd`.
# Let us first create a small vector of the depths of the grid:

depth = vec(grd["zt"])

# We could count the index of the entry we want, but here we will use the `findfirst` function to find the first depth index that is greater than 1000m.
#nb # (Feel free to change the value of `iz` if you want to see a slice at another depth.)

iz = findfirst(depth .> 1000)
iz, depth[iz]

# We get `iz = 13`, which is a layer that lies at 1104m, close to 1000m like we wanted.
#
# Finally, we need the latitude and longitudes of the grid, contained in `grd`.
# As for `depth`, we can use the OCIM's `grd` output:

lat, lon = vec(grd["yt"]), vec(grd["xt"])

# So these are the latitudes and longitudes of the map we are about to plot.

# A last thing we can do is convert the age from seconds, `u"s"`, to years, `u"yr"`, because the age is large.
# This can be done via the Unitful package (loaded automatically by AIBECS).

age_3d_1000m_yr = age_3D[:,:,iz] * ustrip(1.0u"s" |> u"yr")

# Finally! Let's have a look at this ideal mean age!
# To make figures, here, we use Cartopy.
#nb # (You should have installed Cartopy if you went through the prerequisites correctly).
# To use it we simply type

ENV["MPLBACKEND"]="qt5agg"
using PyPlot, PyCall

colorbar(p, orientation="horizontal")
gcf() # gets the current figure to display

# That's it!
# Good job!
#
# At 1000m, the age ranges from a few years below deep water formation regions (Wedell Sea, North Atlantic), and reaches a dozen of centuries in the North Pacific!
# This is pretty good for so little work!
